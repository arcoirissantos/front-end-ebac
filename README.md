# Front-End course at EBAC

**Here you find my first activity from EBAC uploaded to Github.**

This project consists of a presentation webpage with:

1. front page, where there is an abstract of the other pages and buttons to my social media
2. about me page, where I introduce myself with my skills
3. contact page, where there is a form to contact me.

*To say the truth, I'm practicing using git tool with Github.*
