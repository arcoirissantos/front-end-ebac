			<p>Nowadays it is more than evident the importance of having a website that represents your business. Almost everyone has access to the internet, either through their computer or cell phone. More importantly, more and more people are preferring internet services, especially the new generation. For this reason, if you want your business to continue to thrive, you will certainly need a web page.</p>
	
			<p>Before hiring a professional, you should look at how your company can be represented on a website. In the following paragraphs, you will be instructed on how you can do this.</p>

				</ol>
	
			<h2 id="topic1">What is expected to have on the homepage?</h2>
	
			<p>The home page is like a summary page. It's where the customer gets an overview of your products and services.</p>
	
			<p>There are two main questions you should ask yourself before building this page. The first question concerns what you offer, your products and services. When you have your products and services well defined, you are halfway to building your homepage.</p>
	
			<p>Second, it is also very important to think about what makes you or your company special compared to others in the same field. Today there are many options. For this reason, you should highlight how you stand out from the crowd.</p>
	
			<p>In addition to these two questions, you might also consider, depending on your business, adding your geographic area. People tend to trust more when there is a physical structure. If your business is virtual, don't worry. You can also put pictures of your place of work, for example. In this section, you can also add when your business is open and some contact information, such as an email.</p>
	
			<h2 id="topic2">What happens on the About Us page?</h2>
	
			<p>If you want to sell a product or offer a service, you need people to trust your business. The About Us page is a great way to achieve this.</p>
	
			<p>First, write a brief description of your business. You might consider, for example, highlighting how long you've been working in the field and the number of people you've reached with your services. Alternatively, if it's about a store, you can, for example, emphasize the size of your business.</p>
	
			<p>Don't forget to show the photos. They can be from inside and outside the company building. If it's a virtual service, you can, for example, show some pictures of your customers using your products.</p>
	
			<p>Of course, you can go even further by adding testimonials and qualifications. Choose some comments from your past customers to be added to your page. It also helps to add some information about your key team, their contact information, experience and qualifications.</p>
	
			<h2 id="topic3">Do I need a news section or blog?</h2>
	
			<p>If you have a lot of new things happening all the time at your company, if you have something new to share at least once a month, then a news section can be a good deal. It shows that your business is current, that it is alive and on the move. Again, it brings confidence, people can follow what is happening with the company.</p>
	
			<p>How about a blog section? Well, if you can write articles showcasing your expertise in the field, it will make your business prosper even more. It not only brings more trust, but also helps your business to be found in search engines like Google. When people look for information and find your website with what they need, there is a great opportunity to sell your service or product.</p>
	
			<h2 id="topic4">What should be considered when creating an e-commerce page?</h2>
	
			<p>Well, for an e-commerce page, it is critical to have well-defined products and their descriptions. In particular, the importance of the description in this section is greater than any previously mentioned. That's because the success in the sale will depend mainly on the optimization of the page of each product for the search engines. Sometimes it's worth considering hiring a professional in Search Engine Optimization.</p>
	
			<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
	
			<p>There's a lot more to building a website, but with the information above, you can get started. With the tools available today, anyone can put a single page alive in the internet world. However, if you need any help, we can guide you from the beginning until the end and make your business thrive in this competitive world.</p>
